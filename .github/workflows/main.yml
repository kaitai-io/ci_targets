      # Ideally, we'd like to get URL for GH Action down to job ID level,
      # and for that we could use Tiryoh/gha-jobid-action@v0.1.2. However,
      # as of v0.1.2, it's a Docker-based action, so it won't run on anything
      # but Linux. The way forward is to rewrite it to be JavaScript-based
      # (see https://github.com/Tiryoh/gha-jobid-action/issues/10), but until
      # this is resolved, we have no GH_JOB_ID, and we approximate GH_HTML_URL
      # down to RUN_ID level.
